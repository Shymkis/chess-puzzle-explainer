                <strong>INFORMED CONSENT FORM FOR RESEARCH BEING CONDUCTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TULSA</strong>

                <br><br>

                <strong> - INTRODUCTION:</strong><br>
                The name of this study is “Addressing Procrastination and Increasing Task Completion Efficiency using AI Agents.” The people conducting this project are Ethan Beaird, undergraduate student in Computer Science, and Selim Karaoglu, PhD student in Computer Science, under the direction of Sandip Sen, PhD, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Tulsa. This document defines the terms and conditions for agreeing to participate in this research study.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - WHY IS THIS RESEARCH STUDY BEING DONE?</strong><br>
                The long-term goal of this research is to study how AI supportive assistants can help individuals lessen procrastination.

                We are interested in understanding what AI agent interventions are effective in reducing procrastination.

                <br><br>

                <strong>WHAT IS THE KEY INFORMATION YOU NEED TO HELP ME DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY OR NOT?</strong>

                <br><br>

                <strong> - WHAT ARE YOU BEING ASKED TO DO?</strong><br>
                If you agree to be in this study, you are being asked to participate in the following:<br><br>

                In our experiments, you will have to complete certain tasks over the course of approximately 25 minutes.

                During the study, you will engage in a series of short sessions with each session containing a variety of simple tasks. These tasks are designed to represent typical daily activities that individuals may encounter.<br><br>

                Throughout the sessions, you will have the opportunity to interact with an AI supportive assistant specifically designed to assist in managing and reducing procrastination tendencies.<br><br>

                You will be asked to complete one brief survey before the simulation, two brief surveys during the simulation, and one brief survey at the end of the simulation.<br><br>

                The study takes approximately 25 minutes to complete. You must complete the study within 45 minutes.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - ANY POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS?</strong><br>
                No foreseeable risks or discomforts, beyond those present in routine daily life, are anticipated in this study.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - ANY DIRECT BENEFITS FOR YOU?</strong><br>
                Although there are no direct benefits for you, you will help the researchers to understand how procrastination can be more effectively mitigated and contribute to scientific research.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - ANY PAID COMPENSATION FOR YOUR TIME?</strong><br>
                If you complete the study in its entirety (all experiments and surveys) and provide valid responses during the study, you will be paid $2.50 through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Additional payments, of up to $1.00, will be paid depending on performance, which is based on how well you perform in your selected tasks. If you do not complete the study within the time-limit (45 minutes), your study will be ‘rejected,’ and you will not receive compensation. You may participate in this study only once. If you are disqualified from or otherwise finish the study, you may not participate again.
                <br><br>
                To make sure you are paying attention and putting forth adequate effort, the study includes attention checks and commensurate effort measures throughout the study. If you fail 3/10 or more attention checks or do not meet the threshold for effort measures, your work will be ‘rejected,’ and no compensation will be provided. You will not be able to continue the study.
                <br><br>
                At the end of the study, you will receive a code. Please do not submit HIT without the code, as you may risk being rejected.
                <br><br>
                Important: If you don't think that you have answered the responses thoughtfully and you are not sure you will pass a validity check, you should not submit your HIT.
                <br><br>
                You will only receive the compensation if you complete this study to its entirety (all experiments and surveys) and pass the validity and consistency checks within the 45-minute time limit. Please understand that we need to enforce these requirements to ensure the scientific validity of our experimental results.
                <br><br>
                Do not hit back/refresh buttons on the browser, or any browser manipulation, as it may affect the study, and violate the terms of the study, and may result in rejections. If you have any issues, please email Ethan Beaird (ecb8918@utulsa.edu), and we can review the logs to see what happened and help you.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - HOW WILL YOUR INFORMATION/PRIVACY BE PROTECTED?</strong><br>
                During the study, you will not be asked any personal information except your MTurk worker ID (i.e., the 14 character sequence of letters and numbers used to identify workers). Your worker ID is necessary to link your work and worker ID for compensation. In other words, we need your worker ID to confirm that you successfully completed the task and to determine the exact amount of compensation based on your score in the study.
                <br><br>
                Your MTurk worker ID will NOT be shared with anyone and will be kept on the researcher's password-protected computer and then deleted from our system after completing the study. The unidentifiable data will be kept on the researcher’s password-protected file, only accessible to the researcher. Furthermore, the web application where you will work on the task does not read/record your IP, location, or any other personal information.

                <br><br>Please note that MTurk has specific privacy policies of their own. If you have concerns, you should consult them directly at <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/privacynotice">https://www.mturk.com/mturk/privacynotice</a>

                <br><br>

                <strong> - WHAT IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SUBJECTS THE RESEARCHERS PLAN TO RECRUIT FOR THIS STUDY?</strong><br>
                We expect to recruit up to 500 subjects for this study.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS OF YOUR PARTICIPATION AND CAN YOU LEAVE THE STUDY BEFORE IT ENDS?</strong><br>
                You must be at least 18 years old and reside in the United States to participate in this study. Participation is voluntary. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Your participation in this study is approximately 25 minutes. However, you can leave the study at any time, even if you have not finished, but you will be compensated only based on the compensation rules listed earlier.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - CAN YOUR INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THIS STUDY BE SHARED OR USED BY OTHERS?</strong><br>
                Your identifiable information (MTurk worker ID) collected for this research study will not be used or distributed to other investigators for future research studies, even if your identifiers are removed.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - HOW WILL THE RESULTS BE USED?</strong><br>
                Results of this study, including summarized analysis of aggregated survey data, may be published on websites and in peer-reviewed conference proceedings, journals, and presentations. All surveys and modification efforts will be identified with random numbers. The data collected will be aggregated and used for research. As the data will be summarized across all participants, we will not be able to identify you from your data.

                <br><br>

                <strong> - WHO CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS STUDY?</strong><br>
